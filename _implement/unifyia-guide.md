## Executive Summary

<p align="justify">This guide provides a detailed framework for implementing passkeys (FIDO2) using external security keys, smart cards, and digital wallets for federal agencies and relying parties. The goal of passkey-based authentication (FIDO2) is to strengthen security, ease operational burdens for governments, relying parties, and users, and align with modern cybersecurity mandates by enabling phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication.</p>

The document covers:

- An introduction to the Unifyia platform and its capabilities
- An overview of Passkey (FIDO2) fundamentals
- Best practices for implementation
- System configurations required for passkey issuance
- User self-service issuance and lifecycle processes
- On behalf of the user, operator-driven issuance and lifecycle processes
- **One-click issuance of multiple passkeys (FIDO2):** Easily issue multiple passkeys (FIDO2) credentials on behalf of relying parties, such as Entra ID, Okta, and others, without the need for federation.
- User authentication using the issued credentials
- Comprehensive granular lifecycle management of issued credentials

<p align="justify">Memorandum M-19-17, issued by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), highlighted the urgent need to modernize federal IT infrastructure and protect government systems from growing cyber threats. It paved the way for adopting advanced, scalable, and future-proof identity solutions that are not only phishing-resistant and secure but also user-friendly and cost-effective. This directive was instrumental in providing federal agencies and enterprises using PIV (Personal Identity Verification), PIV-I (Interoperable), or CIV (Commercial Identity Verification) credentials the flexibility to transition to modern, passwordless authentication technologies—such as FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online) and Derived Credentials—aligned with Zero Trust security principles.</p>

<p align="justify">The shift to remote work, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted the need for authentication methods beyond PIV-based smart cards to maintain strong security while supporting remote operations. As newer computing devices—especially mobile ones—became prevalent, the use of PIV cards posed significant challenges. To address these issues, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-157 introduced the Derived PIV (DPIV) credential, built from the primary PIV credential. Although DPIV relies on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to enable mobile access, it demands substantial infrastructure investment and ongoing maintenance, making it cumbersome to implement. Its adoption is typically feasible only in environments with well-established PKI infrastructure.</p>

<p align="justify">For broader, more scalable use cases, simpler and more user-friendly alternatives like passkeys (FIDO2) are increasingly favored. These can be deployed as platform authenticators on devices using biometrics, as cross-platform authenticators through external security keys, or within modern mobile wallets.</p>

<p align="justify">FIDO2 passkeys and Derived FIDO2 Credentials (DFCs) play a crucial role in modernizing government and enterprise security by leveraging cryptographic keys for passwordless and phishing-resistant authentication. FIDO2’s compatibility across major platforms (Windows, Android, iOS, macOS) and browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari) makes it a robust solution for enhancing both security and user experience in digital authentication.</p>

<!-- Start of Section 2 -->

## Scope

<!-- Start of Section 4 -->

## Passkeys (FIDO2) Fundamentals

**What are Passkeys (FIDO2)?**

<p align="justify">Passkeys, based on FIDO2 standards, replace traditional passwords with cryptographic key pairs, providing a secure, passwordless login experience and strong protection against phishing and other cyber attacks. They rely on two core FIDO2 components: WebAuthn, which facilitates passwordless authentication on websites and apps using public-private key pairs, and CTAP (Client to Authenticator Protocol), which enables communication between authenticators (e.g., USB keys, Touch ID) and web applications.</p>

<p align="justify">Passkeys (FIDO2) offer phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication that meets NIST Authentication Assurance Level 3 (AAL3). Users gain seamless access to federal services through issued passkeys stored on devices or hardware security tokens, such as smart cards, USB keys, or NFC-enabled devices. These passkeys eliminate risks associated with password reuse, credential theft, and phishing, making them a key advancement in the future of online authentication and an integral part of the modern digital security landscape.</p>

**What are Derived FIDO2 Credentials (DFCs)?**

<p align="justify">Derived FIDO2 Credentials (DFCs), also known as DFIDO2 or DFC passkeys, are derived from an individual's existing primary credentials, such as Personal Identity Verification (PIV), Personal Identity Verification – Interoperable (PIV-I), or Common Access Cards (CAC). DFCs allow users to authenticate and access secure systems or services without needing a physical PIV ID card. These credentials play a vital role in a zero-trust security framework, ensuring that all authentication events are protected through public-key cryptography.</p>

<p align="justify">The issuance of both passkeys (FIDO2) and DFC passkeys adheres to NIST SP 800-63-4 and FIPS 201-3 standards, which promote strong multifactor authentication (MFA) and require cryptographic protection to ensure the integrity and security of sensitive data.</p>

**Supported Form Factors for Passkey (FIDO2) Issuance**

<p align="justify">The Unifyia platform supports issuing passkeys (FIDO2) in a variety of form factors, accommodating different devices, user preferences, and security needs. When selecting a form factor, organizations should prioritize ease of use, portability, security, and recovery options. The supported form factors generally fall into three categories: platform authenticators, cross-platform authenticators, and digital wallets.</p>
- **Platform Authenticators:** 
<p align="justify">Platform authenticators are passkeys stored directly on the user’s device. These are tied to a specific platform (e.g., smartphone, laptop, desktop, or tablet) and leverage the device’s built-in security features for authentication. The Unifyia platform enables organizations to store passkeys on mobile devices by using biometric features such as Face ID, Touch ID, and Android Biometrics. Alternatively, device passcodes or patterns can be used. For modern desktops and laptops, the Unifyia platform supports passkey (FIDO2) issuance and storage using TPM (Trusted Platform Module) or secure enclaves, which protect private keys from unauthorized access, ensuring they remain secure on the device.</p>

- **Cross-platform Authenticators:** 
<p align="justify">Cross-platform authenticators, often called external security keys, are portable hardware devices that store passkeys and can be used across multiple devices. The Unifyia platform supports issuing passkeys (FIDO2) on connected devices like smart cards and security keys through various interfaces, including USB, NFC, Bluetooth, and hybrid security keys that combine multiple connection types (e.g., USB + NFC + Bluetooth). These versatile keys enhance mobility and security by allowing users to authenticate across different platforms seamlessly.</p>

- **Passkeys (FIDO2) on Unifyia ID Wallet:** 
<p align="justify">A standout feature of the Unifyia platform is its ability to issue identity credentials and passkeys (FIDO2) through the Unifyia ID Wallet app, available on both Android and iOS. This secure digital wallet provides an intuitive solution for managing digitally signed credentials on mobile devices, issued directly via the Unifyia platform. It offers passwordless, phishing-resistant mobile authentication, integrating seamlessly with existing frameworks for multifactor authentication (MFA) and identity verification. Through the Unifyia ID Wallet, organizations can issue visual PIV, PIV-I, and CIV identities, as well as OTPs, PKI (PIV/DPIV credentials), Consent, and FIDO2 credentials - all within one app.</p>

**Passkeys (FIDO2) - Key Highlights**

- Aligned with NIST SP 800-63-4 and FIPS 201 standards, promoting strong multifactor authentication (MFA) with cryptographic protection for data integrity and security.
- Passkeys (FIDO2) support federal zero-trust architecture by eliminating the need for traditional passwords.
- They offer robust authentication without the complexity of managing a full PKI infrastructure, simplifying deployment while maintaining high-security standards.
- Passkeys (FIDO2) provide phishing-resistant, passwordless authentication, ensuring seamless access to applications and services.
- They enhance interoperability between agencies by following federated identity management protocols, allowing a single passkey (FIDO2) to be used securely across multiple government services. This reduces the need for MFA or two-step verification, as passkeys provide top-tier security on their own.
- The solution is scalable, enabling federal agencies to extend strong authentication to new technologies and services, ensuring future readiness.

**How do Passkeys (FIDO2) Work?**

- **Public-private key cryptography:** When a user registers for a service using passkeys (FIDO2), the device generates a key pair - a private key that remains securely on the user’s device and a public key that is shared with the service. The private key is never exposed or transmitted, significantly enhancing security.
- **Authentication:** To log in, the user verifies their identity using biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition), a PIN, a pattern, or a hardware token like a security key. The private key then signs an authentication challenge from the service, proving the user’s identity without sharing sensitive information. The service verifies the signed challenge using the stored public key, confirming the user's identity.

**Best Practices for Implementing Passkeys (FIDO2)**

<p align="justify">Unifyia recommends the following best practices for implementing passkeys (FIDO2) within government and federal agencies to create a secure, phishing-resistant, and user-friendly passwordless authentication environment:</p>

- **Use passkeys (FIDO2) as part of a multi-factor authentication (MFA) strategy:** Incorporating passkeys alongside other authentication factors strengthens security.
- **Support multiple authenticator types:** Ensure compatibility with platform authenticators (passkeys stored on user devices), cross-platform authenticators (passkeys on external security keys or smart cards), and digital wallets. This provides flexibility across devices and services, allowing users to authenticate securely from various platforms.
- **Comply with FIDO2/WebAuthn and FIPS standards:** Ensure external security keys and smart cards are compliant with FIDO2/WebAuthn and FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic standards for secure passkey storage.
- **Implement essential security checks:** Ensure the use of user presence verification, user authentication (e.g., biometrics), and the cryptographic challenge-response model to verify the legitimacy of authentication requests.
- **Configure risk-based authentication:** For high-risk scenarios such as logging in from a new device, location, or network, enforce additional verification measures without compromising user convenience.
- **Promote usability and user education:** Focus on ease of use and educate users on the benefits and security of passkeys (FIDO2). Provide clear guidance on how to use and recover passkeys.
- **Provide backup and recovery options:** Offer mechanisms for users to recover access if they lose their passkeys (FIDO2), such as using backup devices or reissuing new passkeys.
- **Maintain a strong auditing system:** Implement continuous monitoring to detect suspicious activities or policy violations, ensuring swift detection and response to potential threats.

## Passkeys (FIDO2) Implementation Using the Unifyia Platform

<p align="justify">The implementation of the passkeys (FIDO2) within federal agencies involves technical and policy aspects while ensuring alignment with federal standards. The issuance of the passkeys (FIDO2) can be operator-based or self-issued by a user based on the organization's policies. The passkeys (FIDO2) implementation for government and federal agencies using the Unifyia platform focuses on issuing passkeys (FIDO2) on external security keys/smart cards and the Unifyia ID Wallet app. The following are the considerations for implementing the strategy:</p>
![Passkeys (FIDO2) Implementation Strategy]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/unifyia/0-fido2-implementation-strategy.png)

- **Role-based access control:** Define granular user controls by allowing role-based access privileges. The Unifyia platform supports PIV roles and also the generic operator and administrator roles. It allows you to assign privileges as required to a specific role.
- **Configure FIDO2 policies and workflows:** Define the policy considerations for the implementation and configure the FIDO2 policies and workflows required for the defined implementation.
- **Device profiles:** Configure the device profiles for hardware tokens such as YubiKeys, smart cards such as ZTPass smart cards, and the Unifyia ID Wallet app that can be issued for issuance. This enables flexibility for remote and mobile workforce requirements.
- **System integration:** Agencies must configure identity management systems and relying parties including integration with federated identity providers to support FIDO2 workflows.
- **MFA:** Define the authentication policies for the platform and integrated relying parties. You can configure a default authentication method and set a preferred order of options for multi-factor authentication.
- **User enrollment:** Define a user enrollment strategy. The Unifyia platform allows multiple options to onboard users simplifying the enrollment process for users:
  - Operators can sponsor and enroll new users.
  - Users can leverage existing federal identity credentials (e.g., PIV cards) to onboard and enroll.
  - Users can leverage the existing credentials of the integrated identity providers to enroll using OpenID Connect (OIDC) or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocols. The platform currently supports Entra ID and Okta.
  - User provisioning using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol.
  - Provisioning on behalf of relying parties such as Entra ID and Okta.
  - Enterprise connections using custom APIs.
  - Integrate external credential management systems using REST APIs to enable enrollment and issuance.
- **Issuance policies:** Define the type of authenticators that can be issued – cross-platform authenticators (external security keys/smart cards) and/or mobile FIDO2 credentials. Define policies for the issuance and management of derived credentials such as DFC. The platform supports the following identity devices for the issuance of the FIDO2 credentials:
  - IDEMIA- ID-One PIV 2.4 + FIDO2.1 on Cosmo V8.2
  - ZTPass - ZTPass PIV 2.0 + FIDO2.1 on NXP P71D600
  - Yubico - YubiKey 5 Series
  - Digital Wallets (Unifyia ID Wallet app) on Android and iOS mobile devices
- **Granular lifecycle management:** Define and implement granular lifecycle management of the identities, applications, and issued credentials.

### System Configurations

<p align="justify">The system configurations outlined below must be managed by the administrator to support the operator and user workflows detailed in the following sections. For ease of explanation, this guide considers two roles to explain the implementation of the passkeys (FIDO2) – operator (for onboarding, enrollment, issuance, and lifecycle) and user (for self-onboarding, issuance, and lifecycle). Agencies can configure roles and permissions to enforce access restrictions.</p>

- Configure a passkey (FIDO2) registration and authentication policy for your organization and relying parties. Ensure to set the authenticator attachment option to cross-platform. This will restrict the issuance of passkeys (FIDO2) on external security keys and smart cards.
- Integrate directories for user federation.
- Integrate external identity providers (IDPs) for identity and user federation as required based on your implementation strategy and passkey (FIDO2) provisioning.
- Configure the device profiles for the allowed authenticators.
- Configure user provisioning policies.
- Configure workflows for passkey (FIDO2) issuance on security keys/smart cards and/or the Unifyia ID Wallet app.
- Configure roles and privileges.
- Configure MFA policies.
- Access to the Operator or User client based on the role and operating system.
<!-- Start of Section 6 -->

## User Self-Issuance of Passkeys (FIDO2)

<p align="justify">A user can log in to the Unifyia platform and self-issue passkey (FIDO2) credentials or Derived FIDO2 Credentials (DFCs). There are multiple ways for the user to log in to self-onboard and issue credentials based on the defined organization policies.</p>

- Users can log in with the existing trusted credentials such as a username and password issued by the identity providers (IDPs) such as Entra ID or Okta to issue passkeys (FIDO2).
- Users can perform a Certificate Based Authentication (trusted Personal Identification Card (PIV)) to log in, perform PIV credential verification, and issue Derived passkeys (FIDO2).
- If FIDO2 provisioning is configured, then the user can log in with the existing trusted credentials of the IDPs such as Entra ID or Okta, and log in to the relying parties using the issued passkeys (FIDO2).
- Users can log into the platform and issue mobile digital credentials on the Unifyia ID Wallet app. For the FIDO2 credential, the users can use an NFC-enabled device. 

This document focuses exclusively on the issuance of FIDO2 credentials for cross-platform authenticators.

**Unifyia ID Wallet Credentials**

You can view the following credentials on the Unifyia ID Wallet.

**Visual:** The visual credential shows your picture and name if you have used a PIV ID credential for verification or you have completed enrollment with face. In all other cases, you can only view the name.

**FIDO2:** The FIDO2 credential allows a user to log in to the platform using security keys connected over NFC.
<br>

![ID Wallet - Visual Credential]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/unifyia/32-wallet-visual-credential.png)
![ID Wallet - FIDO2 Credential]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/unifyia/33-wallet-fido2-credential.png)

**Consent:** The consent keys are used for approving an authentication request sent to the ID Wallet from the platform or integrated applications.

**PKI:** If you have used a PIV ID card for primary card verification, derived PIV certificates (authentication, digital signature, and encryption) are issued. In all other cases, PIV certificates (authentication, digital signature, and encryption) are issued.

- **Card Authentication:** This certificate allows for the card’s verification in scenarios where direct PIN entry or biometric access might not be available. It provides access to systems or facilities that may not be able to read the PIV Authentication Certificate but still need to validate the card.
- **Authentication:** This credential is used for the certificate-based login requests received as consent requests or push notifications from either the platform or third-party applications for passwordless authentication. It is one of the most secure credentials that can be leveraged for authentication.
- **Digital Signature:** This credential is used to sign electronic documents or emails when sent from a mobile device.
- **Encryption:** This credential enables users to encrypt sensitive data, such as emails or files, so that only authorized recipients can decrypt and read the information. This ensures confidentiality, especially in mobile environments where secure communication is critical.

## Granular Lifecycle Management of the Passkeys (FIDO2)

<p align="justify">Granular lifecycle management ensures precise control over identities and credentials throughout their lifecycle, balancing security, usability, and compliance. It allows organizations to tailor credential management based on roles, risk levels, or specific needs, providing flexibility for changing requirements. Detailed tracking and auditing of credential activities help meet regulatory and security compliance. Fine-grained control enables the identification of dormant or misused credentials and allows selective revocation without fully deactivating accounts. Strict recovery procedures minimize the risk of fraudulent access. By enforcing firm controls at each stage, organizations reduce the risks of unauthorized access, insider threats, and credential compromise.</p>

<p align="justify">The platform allows federal agencies and organizations to granularly manage lifecycle actions for identity devices such as smart cards, security keys, mobile devices, applications such as PIV, FIDO2, and issued credentials, for example, PIV authentication certificate, Passkeys (FIDO2), provisioned Passkeys (FIDO2). It allows role-based access to granular lifecycle actions. The lifecycle options are visible based on the status of the identities and credentials.</p>

### Operator Lifecycle Actions

<p align="justify">This section explains the various lifecycle actions that an operator can manage for the identity devices, applications, and issued credentials.</p>

Log into the platform using operator credentials. Navigate to **Management** > **Users**. Search the user either by name or email. Under the _Actions_ column, select the **Identity Lifecycle** icon. All the issued identities are displayed. For each identity, application, and credential, you'll notice that actions are enabled based on their status. To proceed, select **Actions** and choose the desired option. Refer to the images below for a detailed view of the granular lifecycle management.
